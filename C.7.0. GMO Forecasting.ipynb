    "   - Why does GMO believe they can more easily predict **long‑run** than **short‑run** asset‑class performance?\n",

    "   - How has this approach led to **contrarian** positions?\n",
    "   - How does this approach raise **business risk** and **managerial career risk**?\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **The market environment.**\n",
    "   - We often estimate the market risk premium by looking at a large sample of historic data. What reasons does the case give to be skeptical that the market risk premium will be as high **in the future** as it has been **over the past 50 years**?\n",
    "   - In 2007, GMO forecasts **real excess equity returns** will be negative. What are the biggest drivers of their **pessimistic conditional** forecast relative to the **unconditional** forecast? (See Exhibit 9.)\n",
    "   - In the 2011 forecast, what components has GMO revised most relative to 2007? Now how does their conditional forecast compare to the unconditional? (See Exhibit 10.)\n",

    "3. **Consider the asset‑class forecasts in Exhibit 1.**\n",
    "   - Which asset class did GMO estimate to have a **negative 10‑year return** over 2002–2011?\n",
    "   - Which asset classes substantially **outperformed** GMO’s estimate over that time period?\n",
    "   - Which asset classes substantially **underperformed** GMO’s estimate over that time period?\n",
